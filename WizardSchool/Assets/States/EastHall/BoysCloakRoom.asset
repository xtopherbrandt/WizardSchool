  storyText: "You go into the boy's cloak room and look around. No one here but, you
    do feel like you're being watched. So you leave and come back with your invisibility
    cloak rapped around you. \n\nYou look in the mirror and almost jump out of your
    cloak. You don't see yourself, but you do see a tall evil looking man standing
    behind you. \n\nHe can't see you. But he sneakily looks around and then opens
    a door you hadn't seen before. He goes through the door and then shuts it behind
    him. The door practically disappears into the wall.\n\nWhat do you do?\n1. Follow
    the man\n2. Leave the cloak room \n\n"
