  storyText: "You slowly open the door to your classroom. You feel the stones in your
    pocket get hot, and at the same time you feel powerful.\n\nYour teacher, Ms. Dixon,
    is there. She looks like she'd been in a fight. She turns to look at you and her
    face gets softer. In her kind voice, she says \"Oh Hi Charles! I hope you're ready
    for an exciting day.\" She continues, \"I sent the rest of the class home for
    the day. I think you and I need to complete the work on our potion\". \n\n\"Now
    tell me, did you bring the last ingredient?\", she asks, her voice trembling a
    bit. \n\nYou did remember to bring the feathers of golden eaglete, they're in
    your pocket.\n\nWhat do you do?\n1. Give Ms. Dixon the feathers\n2. Give Ms. Dixon
    some lint from your pocket.\n3. Leave the classroom"
