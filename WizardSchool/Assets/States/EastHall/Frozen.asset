  storyText: 'As you turn to leave, Ms Dixon''s voice turns harsh.  "Where are you
    going?", she asks. You stop in your tracks, but not because you thought you should.
    You stop because she has put a freezing spell on you. You are frozen, you can''t
    move.


    Ms. Dixon comes and takes the feathers from your pocket. "Thank you Mr. Lanterman",
    she says as she walks away.


    The freezing will wear off. Some time.
