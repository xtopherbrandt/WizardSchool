  storyText: "You grab the girl and run out of the cloak room. But you were a bit
    to careless and loud. Ms. Dixon comes out of her class room and an evil looking
    man, the Warlock, comes from the boy's cloak room. They look at the two of you
    and smile.\n\nFirst, Ms Dixon puts a freezing spell on the two of you. Then, the
    man searches your pockets and finds some feathers. \n\nThey leave you in the hall
    way, while they go back to Ms. Dixon's class room. You hear evil sounding laughter.\n\nThe
    freezing will wear off...eventually.\n\nPress 1. to Start Again"
