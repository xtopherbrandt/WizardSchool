  storyText: 'It feels a bit wierd, but you go into the girl''s cloak room.  You call
    out "Is someone here?". "Is everything Ok?"


    Then you hear a soft voice urge "Sshh! They''ll find us and hurt us".


    "Who will?", you ask


    "Ms. Dixon and that Warlock she''s working with. They got into a big fight. Something
    about not having all the ingredients for the potion yet. The Warlock was very
    angry and told everyone to get out of the school, or they would be turned into
    vapour. I don''t want to be turned into vapour.", she says.


    What do you do?

    1. Leave the girl in the cloak room

    2. Help the girl escape'
