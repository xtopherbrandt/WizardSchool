  storyText: "\"Thank you\", says the man. \"Now let's finish this\". He takes the
    feathers, greedily and adds it to the flask of potion on the table. \n\nThe potion
    bubbles and bubbles and eventually turns into a golden vapour. It's beautiful.
    \n\nMs. Dixon looks relieved.\n\n\"That is a thing of beauty. This potion will
    make me the most powerful warlock in the kingdom\", his voice rises.  \"And, I
    couldn't have done it without you two. I do thank you, but I will be leaving now.
    So long.\"\n\nThe Warlock leaves the building as a raven through the open window.
    The potion flask tucked tightly in his talons.\n\nYou and Ms. Dixon are relieved.

    with your partners. \n\nPress 1. to Play Again"
