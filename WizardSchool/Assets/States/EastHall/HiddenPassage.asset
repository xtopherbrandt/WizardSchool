  storyText: "You wait a couple of minutes then try to open the door that the man
    went through. It takes you a minute, but you find it. The door opens into a dark
    passage.\n\nYou cautiously enter. The stones in your pocket are getting warm again
    and you feel the strength flowing through your body.\n\nYou quietly walk down
    the passage. Ahead of you is a doorway which is kind of like a oneway glass. You
    can see through it but it doesn't look like the people on the other side can see
    you.\n\nYou watch as the evil man and Ms. Dixon get into an arguement. They eventually
    leave the room together. On the table in the room is a flask of greenish liquid,
    the potion you and Ms. Dixon created. \n\nWhat do you do?\n1. Go into the classroom
    to get the potion\n2. Run back down the passage way "
