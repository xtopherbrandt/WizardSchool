  storyText: "\"Oh, perfect Charles!\", says Ms. Dixon. \"Now let's try it\". She
    takes the lint, greedily and adds it to the flask of potion on the table. \n\nNothing
    happens.\n\nShe looks at you, sternly. \"That was feather from a golden eaglete,
    right?\", she asks in a less than pleasant voice.  \"It should have reacted. It
    should have changed to a golden vapour. What is going on?\", she continues, \"This
    isn't good, Charles. Our sponsor for this work will be very upset. He is coming
    here today to see our progress. This isn't good.\"  She sounds very scared now.\n\nSuddenly,
    seemingly through a wall, walks a man into the room. He is quite evil looking.
    He looks at the potion, looks at you and then at Ms. Dixon. \"Why havn't you added
    the feather yet?\", he asks gruffly. \n\n\"Give me the feathers\", he demands.
    \n\nWhat do you do?\n1. Give the man the feathers\n2. Stand, there stunned"
